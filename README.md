A College Ride-or-Die project we need to do.

## Dependencies

You needed *Vite*'s *ReactJS* library, installed and previewed using npm.

1. go to console, and make sure your directory is set to `(file_path_you're_in)/react_website`
2.  and write `npm create vite@latest`.

To run the website: `npm run dev`.
